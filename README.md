# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project. It is the Triple Peaks Library. I used HTML/CSS to create the website with some hover effects with buttons and links, an animation in the about section, and some smooth transitions (with a keyframes attribute).

## Plan on improving the project

I would say the improvement that could be good would be introducing some concepts from the next sprint (Sprint 3) to prepare us for what's to come or a little preview. The other thing would be sometimes it's a little deceiving on what the final product should look like based on the images because I know I put in the right code, but it doesn't line up exactly with the image all the time. I think that needs to made clearer in the beginning if that is the expectation or the possibility of happening. Another improvement would be if there is a preferred browser to minimize that impact although not exactly sure what that would like or if it's necessary.
